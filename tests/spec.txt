pycall is a flexible python library for creating and using Asterisk call files.
pycall provides python developers with a powerful, but simple API which allows
them to:

* Create Asterisk call files out of python objects.
* Perform basic error checking on `CallFile` attributes, to ensure that the
  call file you're creating has legitimate syntax.
* Write the call files objects to the disk in valid call file format.
* Spool call files with Asterisk so they are executed.
* Set pre-defined date/times to spool your call files with Asterisk.
* Make use of any and all call file attributes / options, utilizing the full
  power of Asterisk call files.
* Choose to either randomly generate the call file names, or specify them
  manually yourself.
* Write call files to various directories, on either a local device, or a
  remotely mounted device.
* Associate any additional `CallFile` attributes your `CallFile` needs (for
  pragmatic purposes) directly with your `CallFile` object.

The rest of this file contains python doctest code to demonstrate and test
these basic functionalities. This is the initial testing code, which is helping
to drive the development and design of the pycall library.


Import dependencies and make sure that the `CallFile` class is available for
usage.

>>> from pycall import CallFile
>>> from datetime import datetime

Create an empty `CallFile` object.

>>> cf = CallFile()

Attempt to spool an empty `CallFile` object. We should see an exception.

>>> cf.spool()	# doctest:+ELLIPSIS
Traceback (most recent call last):
NoChannelDefinedError: "No `channel` attribute specified."

Every call file must have either the `channel` attribute or `trunk_type`,
`trunk_name`, and `number` attributes specified.
