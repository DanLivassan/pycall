Welcome to pycall's documentation!
==================================

Welcome to pycall's documentation. This documentation is divided into different
parts. I would suggest to getting started with the :ref:`installation` docs,
then heading over to the :ref:`quickstart` section. Besides the quickstart
there is also a more detailed :ref:`tutorial` that shows you how to create a
complete (albeit small) application with pycall. If you want to dive into all
the internal parts of pycall, checkout the :ref:`api` documentation.
