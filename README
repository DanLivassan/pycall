pycall
======

A flexible python library for creating and using Asterisk call files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

pycall is useful for developing telephony applications which make use of
outbound calls. Typical usage often looks like this::

	#!/usr/bin/python

	from pycall.callfile import CallFile

	cf = CallFile(
		trunk_type = 'Local',
		trunk_name = 'outbound',
		number = '18002223333',
		application = 'Playback',
		data = 'hello-world',
		user = 'asterisk'
	)
	cf.run()

pycall has been tested using python 2.6.x and Asterisk 1.6.x. It should be
compatible with any python 2.4.x and 2.6.x releases, as well as any Asterisk
1.6.x releases.
